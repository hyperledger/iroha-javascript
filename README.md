## Installation

The packages are published under the `@iroha2` scope into Iroha Nexus Registry. To install them using `npm`/`pnpm`, follow these steps:

1. Configure your package manager to fetch scoped packages from Nexus Registry:

   ```ini
   # FILE: .npmrc
   @iroha2:registry=https://nexus.iroha.tech/repository/npm-group/
   ```

2. Install these packages as any other NPM package:

   ```shell
   npm i @iroha2/client
   yarn add @iroha2/data-model
   pnpm add @iroha2/crypto-target-web
   ```

## Versioning Table

Here is the mapping between Iroha versions and `@iroha2/data-model` package versions:

|     Iroha Version | `@iroha2/data-model` Version | Iroha LTS |
| ----------------: | :--------------------------- | :-------- |
| `2.0.0-pre-rc.20` | `^7.0`                       | LTS       |
| `2.0.0-pre-rc.14` | `^6.0`                       |           |
| `2.0.0-pre-rc.13` | `^5.0`                       |           |
|  `2.0.0-pre-rc.9` | `^4.0`                       | LTS       |
|  `2.0.0-pre-rc.6` | `^3.0`, `^2.0`, `~1.4`       | LTS       |

**Note:** After version `1.2` versions of `@iroha2/data-model` and `@iroha2/client` packages are the same. E.g. for `@iroha/data-model` of version `1.2` the according version of `@iroha2/client` package is also `1.2`.

## Maintenance

Make sure you have installed **Node.js v16.17 or v18**. As for a package manager, this project uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/).

Also make sure you have installed the following version of **Rust toolchain**:

```bash
rustup default nightly-2023-06-25
```

Before working with the repository, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Scripts

Most tasks are defined via [Jake](https://github.com/jakejs/jake), a JavaScript build tool. To explore available tasks, run:

```bash
pnpm jake -t
```

However, some tasks are defined directly in `package.json` and could be run with `pnpm run`:

- Check or fix lint errors:

  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  pnpm lint --fix
  ```

- Fix formatting:

  ```bash
  pnpm format:fix
  ```

Each monorepo package might have its own scripts and tasks. You can find the package details in a README for that package.

### Manually update reference Iroha version

1. Update `packages/iroha-source/config.js`:

   ```js
   export default {
     origin: 'https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git',
     rev: '52dc18cd81bdc1d1906ffeecb666dd9b2eb27955',
   }
   ```

2. Perform full-featured repo check, running:

   ```bash
   pnpm jake run-all-checks
   ```

3. If something is broken, fix it!

4. If you are going to publish updated SDK, update `packages/client/README.md` and `packages/data-model/README.md`. In the beginning they have the following note:

   > This package targets `hyperledger/iroha` at current `iroha2-lts` branch, which has a hash `b783f10fa7de26ed1fdd4c526bd162f8636f1a65`.

   Put here a new Iroha 2 reference commit information.
